## Introduction

Export your quantized model in the following formats:
* TensorFlow models can be exported as Tensorflow models (`.h5` extension) and TFLite models (`.tflite` extension).
* PyTorch models can be exported as torch script models and ONNX models (`.onnx` extension).

### Note
This feature is **experimental and subject to future changes**.
If you have any questions or issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization/issues/new/choose) in this GitHub repository.

## Export TensorFlow Models

To export a TensorFlow model - a quantized model from MCT should be quantized first:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.applications import ResNet50
import model_compression_toolkit as mct

# Create a model
float_model = ResNet50()
# Quantize the model. In order to export the model set new_experimental_exporter to True.
# Notice that here the representative dataset is random. 
quantized_exportable_model, _ = mct.keras_post_training_quantization_experimental(float_model,
                                                                                  representative_data_gen=lambda: [np.random.random((1, 224, 224, 3))],
                                                                                  new_experimental_exporter=True)
```

### INT8 TFLite 
The model will be exported as a tflite model where weights and activations are represented as 8bit integers.

#### Usage Example
```python
import tempfile

# Path of exported model
_, tflite_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.tflite')

# Use mode TFLiteExportMode.INT8 for INT8 data type.
mct.tflite_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model,
                        save_model_path=tflite_file_path,
                        mode=mct.TFLiteExportMode.INT8)
```
Compare size of float and quantized model:
```python
import os

# Save float model to measure its size
_, float_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.h5')
float_model.save(float_file_path)

print("Float model in Mb:", os.path.getsize(float_file_path) / float(2**20))
print("Quantized model in Mb:", os.path.getsize(tflite_file_path) / float(2**20))
print(f'Compression ratio: {os.path.getsize(float_file_path)/os.path.getsize(tflite_file_path)}')
```

### Fakely-Quantized TFLite 
The model will be exported as a tflite model where weights and activations are quantized but represented as float.
Notice that activation quantizers are implemented using [tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/quantization/fake_quant_with_min_max_vars) operators. 

#### Usage Example
```python
import tempfile

# Path of exported model
_, tflite_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.tflite')

# Use mode TFLiteExportMode.FAKELY_QUANT for fakely-quantized weights and activations
mct.tflite_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model,
                        save_model_path=tflite_file_path,
                        mode=mct.TFLiteExportMode.FAKELY_QUANT)
```

Notice that the fakely-quantized model has the same size as the quantized exportable model as weights data types are float.


### Fakely-Quantized h5 
The model will be exported as a tensorflow `.h5` model where weights and activations are quantized but represented as float.

#### Usage Example
```python
import tempfile

# Path of exported model
_, h5_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.h5')

# Use mode KerasExportMode.FAKELY_QUANT for fakely-quantized weights and activations
mct.keras_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model,
                       save_model_path=h5_file_path,
                       mode=mct.KerasExportMode.FAKELY_QUANT)
```

Notice that the fakely-quantized model has the same size as the quantized exportable model as weights data types are float.

## Export PyTorch models

To export a PyTorch model - a quantized model from MCT should be quantized first:

```python
import model_compression_toolkit as mct
import numpy as np
import torch
from torchvision.models.mobilenetv2 import mobilenet_v2

# Create a model
float_model = mobilenet_v2()
# Quantize the model. In order to export the model set new_experimental_exporter to True.
# Notice that here the representative dataset is random.
def representative_data_gen():
    for i in range(1):
        yield [np.random.random((1, 3, 224, 224))]

quantized_exportable_model, _ = mct.pytorch_post_training_quantization_experimental(float_model,
                                                                                    representative_data_gen=representative_data_gen,
                                                                                    new_experimental_exporter=True)
```

### Fakely-Quantized ONNX 

The model will be exported in ONNX format where weights and activations are quantized but represented as float.

#### Usage Example
```python
import tempfile

# Path of exported model
_, onnx_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.onnx')

# Use mode PyTorchExportMode.FAKELY_QUANT_ONNX for fakely-quantized weights and activations
mct.pytorch_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model,
                         save_model_path=onnx_file_path,
                         mode=mct.PyTorchExportMode.FAKELY_QUANT_ONNX,
                         # A representative dataset is required
                         repr_dataset=representative_data_gen)
```

Notice that the fakely-quantized model has the same size as the quantized exportable model as weights data types are float.



### Fakely-Quantized TorchScript 

The model will be exported in TorchScript format where weights and activations are quantized but represented as float.

#### Usage Example
```python
import tempfile

# Path of exported model
_, torchscript_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.pt')

# Use mode PyTorchExportMode.FAKELY_QUANT_TORCHSCRIPT for fakely-quantized weights and activations
mct.pytorch_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model,
                         save_model_path=torchscript_file_path,
                         mode=mct.PyTorchExportMode.FAKELY_QUANT_TORCHSCRIPT,
                         # A representative dataset is required
                         repr_dataset=representative_data_gen)
```

Notice that the fakely-quantized model has the same size as the quantized exportable model as weights data types are float.
