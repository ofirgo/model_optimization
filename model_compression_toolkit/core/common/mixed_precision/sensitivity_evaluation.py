            Create an object that allows to compute the sensitivity metric of an MP model (the sensitivity
            is computed based on the similarity of the interest points' outputs between the MP model
            and the float model).
            First, we initiate a SensitivityEvaluationManager that handles the components which are necessary for
            evaluating the sensitivity. It initializes an MP model (a model where layers that can be configured in
            different bit-widths) and a baseline model (a float model).
            Then, and based on the outputs of these two models (for some batches from the representative_data_gen),
            we build a function to measure the sensitivity of a change in a bit-width of a model's layer.
